# Limitations and Ethical Considerations

While MarketMind aims to improve stock prediction accuracy, it is important to acknowledge limitations and ethical considerations inherent in financial forecasting systems.

---

## Technical Limitations

- Overfitting to historical data
- Sensitivity to noisy signals
- Dependence on data quality and availability
- Degradation during unprecedented market events

No model can perfectly predict financial markets.

---

## Interpretation Risks

Predictions may be misinterpreted as guarantees rather than probabilistic estimates. MarketMind is intended as a decision-support tool, not financial advice.

---

## Ethical Considerations

- Responsible use of predictions
- Avoiding misleading confidence
- Transparency about uncertainty

MarketMind emphasizes clarity, context, and responsible communication of results.
