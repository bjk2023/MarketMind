This GeeksforGeeks article explains how to predict stock prices using machine learning in Python, 
with Tesla's stock data as a case study.

Process Overview
The article details a complete workflow for building a predictive model:

Data Handling: It starts by importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn,
 then loads and explores the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The author visualizes data to understand trends and distributions.

Feature Engineering: New, potentially predictive features are created from existing data. For example,
 the 'Date' is broken down into 'day', 'month', and 'year'.

Modeling: The data is split into training and validation sets, and features are normalized. 
Three models are trained:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost

Evaluation: The models' performance is evaluated using the ROC-AUC score.

Conclusion
While XGBoost showed high accuracy on the training data, it appeared to overfit. Logistic Regression, 
despite having lower accuracy, demonstrated more consistent performance. Ultimately, the author 
concludes that the models' predictions were not significantly better than random guessing, 
suggesting that more data or more complex models might be needed for this task.
