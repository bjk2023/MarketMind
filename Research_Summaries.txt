This GeeksforGeeks article explains how to predict stock prices using machine learning in Python, 
with Tesla's stock data as a case study.

Process Overview
The article details a complete workflow for building a predictive model:

Data Handling: It starts by importing essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn,
 then loads and explores the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The author visualizes data to understand trends and distributions.

Feature Engineering: New, potentially predictive features are created from existing data. For example,
 the 'Date' is broken down into 'day', 'month', and 'year'.

Modeling: The data is split into training and validation sets, and features are normalized. 
Three models are trained:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost

Evaluation: The models' performance is evaluated using the ROC-AUC score.

Conclusion
While XGBoost showed high accuracy on the training data, it appeared to overfit. Logistic Regression, 
despite having lower accuracy, demonstrated more consistent performance. Ultimately, the author 
concludes that the models' predictions were not significantly better than random guessing, 
suggesting that more data or more complex models might be needed for this task.

What I Learned
The main idea is to try and guess where a stock's price will go. One method for doing this is called Linear Regression,
which basically means drawing a single straight line through a bunch of past data points to see the trend.

The computer's job is to find the "best" line possible—the one that runs closest to all the real data dots.

The Steps I Have to Follow
The article laid out a clear recipe for me to follow:

Get My Computer Ready: First, I need to add some special tools to Python that can help with numbers and making graphs. The article mentioned using tools like pandas and scikit-learn.

Split My Data in Two: I can't use all my historical data to teach the computer. I have to split it into two piles:

A training pile, which I show the computer so it can learn the pattern and draw its line.

A testing pile, which I keep hidden at first. I use this later to check the computer's work on data it has never seen before.

Check How Good the Guesses Are: Once the computer draws its line, I use the "testing pile" to see how accurate it is. The article mentioned two main ways to score it:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This score tells me, on average, how far off my computer's guesses were from the real prices. A smaller number is better.

R-squared (R²): This score is between 0 and 1 and tells me how well the line fits the data. A score closer to 1 is better.
