Summary: In this study, the use of machine learning, and more specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, is explored for predicting trends in Vietnam's stock market's stock prices. The authors combined LSTM with technical indicators SMA, MACD, and RSI, and VN-Index and VN30 stock data, and achieved about 93% accuracy in their predictions. Their findings indicate that LSTM is a good fit for time series data such as stock prices, as it is able to deal with both short- and long-term patterns. Although the study only considers LSTM, the authors mention that using several algorithms together or adding unstructured data (such as text or news) would be able to enhance prediction performance even more. They also acknowledge limitations, as their data was confined to the Ho Chi Minh City market, which can be manipulated and volatile. Overall, the study acknowledges the potential of LSTM in stock prediction but sees areas that should be enhanced in the future.

Summary: This article outlines how interest rates impact the stock market in 2025. Although relatively high, rates have leveled out at 4â€“5% levels, helping the S&P 500 to reach all-time highs after prior volatility. Higher interest rates tend to increase the price of borrowing and reduce profits for businesses, but stable rates have helped stocks because earnings and inflation have been steady. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates modestly in 2025 and again in 2026, which is viewed by investors as bullish for stocks. Sector action has been a mixed bag with utilities, industrials, and technology doing well and defensive industries like consumer staples underperforming. Generally speaking, the view is that while stocks are prone to short-term fluctuations, they are a required part of a long-term portfolio.
