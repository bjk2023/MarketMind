Hyperbolic deep learning provides a framework for representing hierarchical structures efficiently, which is highly relevant to financial market data. Stock markets naturally form hierarchies such as market → sector → industry → firm, as well as relationships between macroeconomic indicators and individual securities. By embedding these relationships in hyperbolic space, a stock tracker can preserve structural similarity more accurately than Euclidean embeddings, improving clustering and similarity searches between stocks.

The survey highlights how hyperbolic embeddings reduce distortion when representing exponentially branching structures. In the context of a stock tracker, this enables better organization of equities by sector and risk exposure, improving recommendation systems and peer comparisons. For example, a tracker could more accurately identify comparable firms or sector-wide movements, improving portfolio diversification insights.

Finally, the paper’s discussion of optimization challenges informs system design trade-offs. While hyperbolic models increase computational cost, the stock tracker could selectively apply them to relationship modeling rather than price prediction. This makes hyperbolic learning a targeted enhancement rather than a full replacement, strengthening structural analysis without sacrificing performance.
