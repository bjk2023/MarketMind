# Architecture Comparison: Linear Regression vs MarketMind

This document provides a conceptual comparison between a traditional linear regression pipeline and the MarketMind architecture.

---

## Linear Regression Pipeline

1. Historical price data
2. Manual feature selection
3. Linear model fitting
4. Single-point prediction

This approach is simple and interpretable but limited in expressive power.

---

## MarketMind Architecture

1. Multi-source data ingestion
2. Feature engineering across domains
3. Machine learning model training
4. Multi-metric evaluation
5. Context-aware interpretation

MarketMind is designed to handle nonlinear patterns, adapt to market changes, and provide more actionable insights.

## Key Differences

- Flexibility vs simplicity
- Adaptability vs static assumptions
- Contextual awareness vs price-only modeling

Linear regression serves as a baseline, while MarketMind represents a scalable, real-world prediction system.
