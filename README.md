# MarketMind

MarketMind is an RCOS open-source project focused on building a machine-learning-driven stock market prediction and analysis platform. The goal of the project is to explore how modern ML techniques can outperform traditional statistical baselines when applied to real-world financial data.

This branch focuses on research documentation, model comparison, and system justification.

## Overview

Stock price movements are influenced by a combination of historical trends, market activity, macroeconomic conditions, and investor sentiment. Traditional models such as linear regression struggle to capture these complex, nonlinear relationships.

MarketMind addresses this limitation by:
- Incorporating multiple data sources
- Supporting nonlinear modeling approaches
- Emphasizing prediction accuracy and adaptability
- Providing context through research and market analysis

---

## Project Goals

- Compare machine learning–based prediction methods against linear regression baselines
- Analyze prediction accuracy, responsiveness, and limitations
- Integrate market context such as news and macroeconomic signals
- Build a modular foundation for future expansion

## Why Not Linear Regression?

Linear regression assumes a fixed linear relationship between historical inputs and future prices. While useful as a baseline, it:
- Underfits nonlinear market behavior
- Lags during volatility and regime shifts
- Cannot incorporate qualitative signals like sentiment or news

MarketMind is designed to overcome these limitations by learning complex patterns directly from data and adapting to changing market conditions.

## Accuracy Focus

MarketMind prioritizes predictive accuracy and directional correctness rather than simple curve fitting. By integrating richer features and machine learning models, the system aims to:
- Improve responsiveness to market-moving events
- Reduce lag in predictions
- Maintain performance across different market regimes

Linear regression remains useful as a benchmark but is not sufficient for real-world deployment.
