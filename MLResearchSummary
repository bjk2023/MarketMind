Summary of article: The article from Itransition discusses how machine learning (ML) can enhance stock market forecasting by analyzing large datasets, 
including historical prices, financial indicators, and market sentiment. ML models help traders identify optimal entry and exit points, manage portfolios, 
and implement algorithmic or high-frequency trading strategies, ultimately improving returns and reducing risks. Real-world implementations, such as 
Itransition’s proprietary portfolio management platform, combine historical and real-time data to provide timely trading alerts and strategy recommendations, 
often outperforming traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500.

Summary of Research: 

Python Libraries for Implementation:
Pandas: Data manipulation, cleaning, and time-series handling.
NumPy: Numerical computations, array operations, linear algebra.
scikit-learn: Provides implementations for SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and preprocessing utilities.

Types of ML Models for stock forecasting:

1. Classical Statistical Model
ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
Captures trends, seasonality, and temporal dependencies.
Good for short-term predictions on stable data.
Limitations: struggles with non-linear patterns; requires stationary data.
Libraries: statsmodels in Python.


2. Neural Network Models
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Recurrent Neural Network capable of remembering long-term dependencies.
- Handles complex, non-linear patterns well.
- Libraries: Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Hybrid Approaches
- XGBoost + LSTM: XGBoost selects important features; LSTM forecasts time series.
- LSTM + CNN: CNN captures short-term patterns, LSTM handles long-term trends.
- Sentiment-Integrated Models: Combine financial data with NLP-based sentiment analysis to improve prediction accuracy.


3. Ensemble & Tree-Based Models
Random Forest
- Aggregates multiple decision trees for better stability and reduced overfitting.
- Handles large datasets well.
- Libraries: scikit-learn.
Gradient Boosting
- Builds trees sequentially; each tree corrects the errors of the previous.
- Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.

4. Other Machine Learning Models
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Effective for regression and classification, especially non-linear data.
- Works by finding the optimal separating hyperplane in high-dimensional space.
- Libraries: scikit-learn.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Predicts values based on the outcomes of the closest historical “neighbors.”
- Important to normalize features (stock price, volume, etc.) for proper distance calculation.
- Libraries: scikit-learn.


5. Forecasting Libraries
Prophet (Facebook)
- Designed for time-series forecasting with seasonal effects and missing data.
- Often more accurate and easier to tune than ARIMA.
- Libraries: prophet (Python).

Research no order: 
1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):
- statistical model that captures trends, seasonality, and other time-dependent patterns in a single data series
- good for short term forecasting but harder with non linear relationships and needs it to be stable overtime. 

2. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM):
- can retain information over a long period of time, good for non linear and complex patterns.

3. Prophet
- forecasting library developed by Facebook, can handle missing data and is optimized for data with seasonal patterns. More accurate than ARIMA. 

4. Support Vector Model (SVM):
- algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
- effective for non linear data because they find the optimal seperate the hyperplane in high dimensional feature space 

5. Random Forest
- combines predictions of multiple decision trees
- handles large data sets and reduces overfitting, so it is more accurate. 

6. Gradient Boosting
- builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by previous ones. 

7. K-nearest neighbor
- distance-based technique to forecast the outcome of a certain event according to the records of its most similar historical situations called "neighbors". 
- important to normalize the input data so that all features measured on different scales (e.g., stock price vs trading volume) contribute proportionally to the distance calculation, 
ensuring accurate neighbor selection and high prediction quality.

Hybrid + Ensemble Models

1. XGBoost + LSTM: A common hybrid approach where XGBoost is used for feature selection and the LSTM model is used for the actual time-series forecasting. 
This can produce superior results by leveraging the strengths of both models.
  
2. LSTM + CNN: Combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an LSTM can help identify short-term signals (CNN) and long-term trends (LSTM), 
improving accuracy over either model alone.

3. Sentiment analysis integration: Many hybrid models combine traditional financial data with sentiment scores derived from news articles and social media. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
these models gauge market sentiment to inform their predictions, leading to enhanced accuracy.
