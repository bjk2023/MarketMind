Types of ML Models for stock forecasting:


1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):
- statistical model that captures trends, seasonality, and other time-dependent patterns in a single data series
- good for short term forecasting but harder with non linear relationships and needs it to be stable overtime. 

2. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM):
- can retain information over a long period of time, good for non linear and complex patterns.

3. Prophet
- forecasting library developed by Facebook, can handle missing data and is optimized for data with seasonal patterns. More accurate than ARIMA. 

4. Support Vector Model (SVM):
- algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 
- effective for non linear data because they find the optimal seperate the hyperplane in high dimensional feature space 

5. Random Forest
- combines predictions of multiple decision trees
- handles large data sets and reduces overfitting, so it is more accurate. 

6. Gradient Boosting
- builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by previous ones. 

7. K-nearest neighbor
- distance-based technique to forecast the outcome of a certain event according to the records of its most similar historical situations called "neighbors". 
- important to normalize the input data so that all features measured on different scales (e.g., stock price vs trading volume) contribute proportionally to the distance calculation, 
ensuring accurate neighbor selection and high prediction quality.

Hybrid + Ensemble Models

1. XGBoost + LSTM: A common hybrid approach where XGBoost is used for feature selection and the LSTM model is used for the actual time-series forecasting. 
This can produce superior results by leveraging the strengths of both models.
  
2. LSTM + CNN: Combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an LSTM can help identify short-term signals (CNN) and long-term trends (LSTM), 
improving accuracy over either model alone.

3. Sentiment analysis integration: Many hybrid models combine traditional financial data with sentiment scores derived from news articles and social media. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
these models gauge market sentiment to inform their predictions, leading to enhanced accuracy.
