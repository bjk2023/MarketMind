What I Learned
The main idea is to try and guess where a stock's price will go. One method for doing this is called Linear Regression, 
which basically means drawing a single straight line through a bunch of past data points to see the trend.

The computer's job is to find the "best" line possible—the one that runs closest to all the real data dots.

The Steps I Have to Follow
The article laid out a clear recipe for me to follow:

Get My Computer Ready: First, I need to add some special tools to Python that can help with numbers and making graphs. The article mentioned using tools like pandas and scikit-learn.

Split My Data in Two: I can't use all my historical data to teach the computer. I have to split it into two piles:

A training pile, which I show the computer so it can learn the pattern and draw its line.

A testing pile, which I keep hidden at first. I use this later to check the computer's work on data it has never seen before.

Check How Good the Guesses Are: Once the computer draws its line, I use the "testing pile" to see how accurate it is. The article mentioned two main ways to score it:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This score tells me, on average, how far off my computer's guesses were from the real prices. A smaller number is better.

R-squared (R²): This score is between 0 and 1 and tells me how well the line fits the data. A score closer to 1 is better.
